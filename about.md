Hi, I am Mitro (Mitrasree Deb). I am currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Western Washington University, with an expected graduation date of June 2026. My primary research interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Data Analysis, and Affective Computing. 

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), completed between 2014 and 2018. After obtaining my Bachelors, I worked as an IT Consultant (BI Analyst) for 5 years in Japan and 1 year in Bangladesh.

I aspire to dive deeper into the social issues of communities around me. Qualitative research methods and data analysis in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), User Experience (UX), ICT4D, Ethnography, and Affective Computing are closely aligned with my research interests which I want to pursue actively.

Currently, I am a Graduate Teaching Assistant in the Department of Computer Science and doing my Masters' Research under the KIND (Komputing for Inclusion and Disability) Research Group, advised by Dr. Yasmine Elglaly. I have also actively working in the NEAT (Next Generation Effective Affective Technology) Research Group, advised by Dr. Moushumi Sharmin and Dr. Shameem Ahmed. 

During my undergrad and professional life, I worked under the guidance of Dr. Ishtiaque Ahmed from University of Toronto, which resulted into my first ever research publication with the best paper for honorable mention award in CHI 2021 (Top 5%) which is the most reputable venue in HCI.
